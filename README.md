#### Gameplay/Systems programmer
<!--insert image/videos here-->

Boxed In is a 3D platformer vertical slice about a cat escaping the twisted science expiriments of his handler, Dr.Schrodinger.

Developed in 4 months as a part of my game technologies 2 class, boxed in was developed by a team of 10 students, 2 programmers (including myself), 4 artists, and 4 designers.

During my time working on Boxed In I worked on such mechanics as climbing, patroling robots, ui functionality and various tools for the development team.
